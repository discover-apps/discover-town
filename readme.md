# Discover Town

## Prerequisites
You will need to have node.js installed on your machine in order to install dependencies and run the project.

To check if you have node.js installed type `node -v` in your command line / terminal. You should see something along the lines of:

```shell
v12.14.1
```

## Setup
Download all the files in this directory into a folder of your choice.

Navigate into the folder using the command line and type:

```shell
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are finished installing, run the following command:

```shell
npm run dev
```

This will start the application. Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your web browser to view the application.
